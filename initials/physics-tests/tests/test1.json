    "explanation": "To find the dimensional formula for time $T$, we express it as $T = k G^a h^b c^d$. By substituting the dimensions $[G] = M^{-1}L^3T^{-2}$, $[h] = ML^2T^{-1}$, and $[c] = LT^{-1}$, we set up equations for the exponents of $M$, $L$, and $T$.

    "explanation": "Using the prism formula $n = \\frac{\\sin((A + \\delta_m)/2)}{\\sin(A/2)}$ with $n=\\sqrt{2}$ and $A=60^\\circ$. $\\sin((60 + \\delta_m)/2) = \\sqrt{2} \\sin(30^\\circ) = 1/\\sqrt{2}$, which means $(60 + \\delta_m)/2 = 45^\\circ$, so $\\delta_m = 30^\\circ$."
