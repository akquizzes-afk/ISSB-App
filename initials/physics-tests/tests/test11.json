      "$1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}^2 \\text{ N}^{-1} \\text{ m}^{-2}$",
      "$9 \\times 10^9 \\text{ C}^2 \\text{ N}^{-1} \\text{ m}^{-2}$",
      "$6.67 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ C}^2 \\text{ N}^{-1} \\text{ m}^{-2}$",
      "$8.85 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ C}^2 \\text{ N}^{-1} \\text{ m}^{-2}$"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The permittivity of free space is a physical constant equal to approximately $8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ F/m}$ or $\\text{C}^2 \\text{ N}^{-1} \\text{ m}^{-2}$."
