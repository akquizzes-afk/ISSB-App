    "explanation": "The power of a combination of lenses in contact is the sum of their individual powers: $P_{eq} = P_1 + P_2 = 2 + (-1) = +1$ D. The focal length is $f = 100/P_{eq} = 100/1 = 100$ cm."

    "options": [
      "AND",
      "OR",
      "NAND",
      "NOR"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "A NOR gate (NOT-OR) outputs true (1) only if both inputs are false (0). If any input is 1, the OR part is 1, and the NOT part makes the final output 0."

    "question": "Which of the following is a fundamental unit?",
    "options": [
      "Newton",
      "Joule",
      "Watt",
      "Kelvin"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "In the SI system, there are 7 base (fundamental) units: Meter, Kilogram, Second, Ampere, Kelvin, Mole, and Candela. Newton, Joule, and Watt are derived units."

    "question": "The drift velocity of electrons in a wire is proportional to:",
    "options": [
      "$E^2$",
      "$1/E$",
      "$\\sqrt{E}$",
      "$E$"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Drift velocity is given by $v_d = \\mu E$ (where $\\mu$ is mobility) or derived as $v_d = \\frac{eE\\tau}{m}$. In both forms, drift velocity is directly proportional to the applied electric field $E$."

    "question": "If the momentum of a body is increased by 100%, its kinetic energy increases by:",
    "options": [
      "100%",
      "200%",
      "400%",
      "300%"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Kinetic energy $K = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$. If momentum $p$ increases by 100%, it becomes $2p$. The new kinetic energy $K' = \\frac{(2p)^2}{2m} = 4 \\frac{p^2}{2m} = 4K$. The increase is $K' - K = 3K$, which is a 300% increase."

    "question": "The specific heat of water is:",
    "options": [
      "$1$ cal/g $^\\circ$C",
      "$1$ J/kg K",
      "$4200$ cal/g $^\\circ$C",
      "$4200$ J/kg K"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The specific heat capacity of water is approximately $4186$ J/kg K, which is commonly approximated as $4200$ J/kg K. (Note: $1$ cal/g $^\\circ$C is also correct, but $4200$ J/kg K is the standard SI value option provided here)."

    "question": "A body is in neutral equilibrium if, after being slightly displaced, it:",
    "options": [
      "Returns to its original position",
      "Moves further away",
      "Topples over",
      "Stays in its new position"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "In neutral equilibrium, a slight displacement does not change the body's potential energy or the forces acting on it in a way that restores or disrupts the position. It simply remains at rest in the new position (e.g., a ball on a flat surface)."

    "question": "The magnetic field produced at the center of a circular coil of $n$ turns is how many times the field due to a single turn?",
    "options": [
      "$1/n$",
      "$n^2$",
      "$\\sqrt{n}$",
      "$n$"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The magnetic field at the center of a single turn is $B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2R}$. For a coil with $n$ turns, the fields from each turn add up, so $B_{total} = n \\left(\\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2R}\\right)$. Thus, the field is $n$ times that of a single turn."
