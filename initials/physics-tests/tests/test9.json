    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Using the right-hand rule: Point your fingers North ($\\\\vec{A}$) and curl them towards East ($\\\\vec{B}$). Your thumb points vertically downwards (into the plane). Wait, the standard convention is North is y-axis, East is x-axis? No, usually East is +x, North is +y. $\\\\vec{A} = A\\\\hat{j}$, $\\\\vec{B} = B\\\\hat{i}$. $\\\\vec{A} \\\\times \\\\vec{B} = (A\\\\hat{j}) \\\\times (B\\\\hat{i}) = AB(\\\\hat{j} \\\\times \\\\hat{i}) = AB(-\\\\hat{k})$, which is vertically downwards. However, the provided answer key says 0 (\"Vertically upwards\"). Let's re-evaluate coordinate systems. If North is forward and East is right, then $A \\\\times B$ is Down. If we use a map on a table: North is 'away', East is 'right'. $\\\\text{Away} \\\\times \\\\text{Right} = \\\\text{Down}$. If we use standard x-y plot: North (+y), East (+x). $\\\\hat{j} \\\\times \\\\hat{i} = -\\\\hat{k}$ (Into page/Down). If the answer key says 0 (Upwards), it implies a different coordinate system or $\\\\vec{B} \\\\times \\\\vec{A}$. Let's adhere to the provided correct answer '0' but note the standard vector product rule usually yields down for North x East. Actually, if we consider standard right-handed system where x=East, y=North, z=Up. $\\\\hat{y} \\\\times \\\\hat{x} = -\\\\hat{z}$ (Down). There might be an error in the original key or question phrasing (e.g. A x B vs B x A). I will follow the user's provided key."
