    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Combined power $P = P_1 + P_2 = 12 - 2 = 10$ D. Focal length $f = 100/P = 100/10 = 10$ cm."

    "question": "A simple microscope has a focal length of 5 cm. Its maximum magnifying power is:",
    "options": [
      "5",
      "6",
      "4",
      "25"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Maximum magnification for a simple microscope (at near point of distinct vision $D=25$ cm) is $m = 1 + D/f = 1 + 25/5 = 6$."

      "Mass",
      "Size",
      "Stability",
      "Charge"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Higher binding energy per nucleon indicates that the nucleus is more tightly bound and therefore more stable."

      "$-13.6$ eV",
      "$-3.4$ eV",
      "$-1.51$ eV",
      "$0$ eV"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Energy levels are given by $E_n = -13.6/n^2$ eV. The first excited state corresponds to $n=2$. $E_2 = -13.6/2^2 = -13.6/4 = -3.4$ eV."

    "options": [
      "AND gate",
      "OR gate",
      "NOT gate",
      "NOR gate"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "A NOT gate is an inverter; it produces a high output for a low input and vice versa, effectively reversing the signal."

    "options": [
      "The mass of the body",
      "The location from where it is projected",
      "The direction of projection",
      "The radius of the earth"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Escape velocity $v_e = \\sqrt{2GM/R}$. It depends on the mass $M$ and radius $R$ of the planet (Earth), but not on the mass of the projectile or the angle of projection."

    "question": "Which of the following represents the correct graph between the volume $V$ and temperature $T$ (in Kelvin) for an ideal gas at constant pressure?",
    "options": [
      "A straight line passing through origin",
      "A parabola",
      "A hyperbola",
      "A circle"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "According to Charles's Law, at constant pressure, volume is directly proportional to absolute temperature ($V \\propto T$). This relationship describes a straight line passing through the origin."
