    "explanation": "Induced emf $E = NAB\\omega \\sin(\\omega t)$. The angle in formula is $\\omega t$ (angle between normal and field). When plane is parallel to field (angle $0^\\circ$ with field, normal is $90^\\circ$), flux change is max. Wait, re-read. If plane is parallel to field, flux is zero but rate of change is max. Let's trace formula: $\\Phi = BA \\cos \\theta$ ($\\\\theta$ is angle between NORMAL and field). Emf is proportional to $\\sin \\theta$. Max emf when $\\sin \\theta = 1$, so $\\theta = 90^\\circ$. This means NORMAL is perpendicular to field -> Plane is PARALLEL ($0^\\circ$) to field. Correct answer logic: Angle of *plane* with field is $0^\\circ$."
