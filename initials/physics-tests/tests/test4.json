    "explanation": "The magnetic force is $F = qvB\\sin\\theta$. If the angle $\\theta = 0^\\circ$ (velocity is parallel to the field), $\\sin\\theta = 0$, so the force is zero."

    "options": [
      "$f = \\lambda v$",
      "$v = f / \\lambda$",
      "$\\lambda = f v$",

    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The wave speed equation relates velocity, frequency, and wavelength: Velocity equals frequency times wavelength ($v = f\\lambda$)."
