      "Low altitude and low temperature",
      "High altitude and high temperature"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "To lift efficiently, the density difference between the gas inside (Hydrogen) and the air outside needs to be maximized. At low altitudes, air density is higher, providing greater buoyant force. High temperature of the surrounding air would decrease its density, which is not ideal, but high temperature inside the balloon decreases the density of hydrogen further. However, the standard answer interpretation often relies on the condition where the surroundings are dense (low altitude) and the gas inside is light. Among the options, low altitude provides the dense medium needed for lift."

    "explanation": "According to the Lens Maker's Formula, $\\frac{1}{f} = (\\frac{\\mu_l}{\\mu_m} - 1)(\\frac{1}{R_1} - \\frac{1}{R_2})$. If the refractive index of the lens $\\mu_l$ equals that of the medium $\\mu_m$, the term $(\\frac{\\mu_l}{\\mu_m} - 1)$ becomes zero. Thus, $\\frac{1}{f} = 0$, which implies $f = \\infty$ (infinite focal length). The lens behaves like a plane glass sheet."

    "options": [
      "Generating low frequency waves",
      "Combining audio signals with a carrier wave",
      "Separating audio signals from a carrier wave",
      "Amplifying a signal"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Modulation involves varying properties (amplitude, frequency, or phase) of a high-frequency carrier wave in accordance with a low-frequency information signal (audio) to enable transmission over long distances."

    "question": "The depletion layer in a p-n junction contains:",
    "options": [
      "Electrons only",
      "Holes only",
      "Immobile ions",
      "Protons only"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The depletion region is formed when mobile charge carriers (electrons and holes) diffuse across the junction and recombine. This leaves behind uncovered, immobile positive ions on the n-side and negative ions on the p-side."

    "options": [
      "$0^\\circ$C",
      "$4^\\circ$C",
      "$-4^\\circ$C",
      "$100^\\circ$C"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Due to the anomalous expansion of water, it contracts when heated from $0^\\circ$C to $4^\\circ$C. At $4^\\circ$C, its volume is minimum and therefore its density is maximum."

      "Infinite"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "According to Newton's second law ($F_{net} = ma$), if the net force $F_{net}$ is zero, the acceleration $a$ must also be zero."
