    "explanation": "NOTE: For an *ideal* toroid, the field is often considered uniform if the radius is large compared to the cross-section. However, strictly speaking, $B = \\frac{\\mu_0 N I}{2\\pi r}$, so it varies as $1/r$. The provided answer key (0: Constant) implies the approximation of a very thin toroid or 'average' field is being tested, or it refers to the field being non-zero and confined inside (unlike outside where it is zero). Given the options, 'Constant' is the intended answer in many simplified contexts compared to 'Zero'."
