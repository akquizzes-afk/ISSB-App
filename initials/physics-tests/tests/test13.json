    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Moving electrons constitute current. Currents in the same direction attract magnetically. However, electrostatic repulsion is much stronger. But in the context of purely magnetic effects (Ampere's law), they attract. (Note: In vacuum, electrostatic repulsion dominates, but textbooks often focus on the 'current' aspect implying attraction or ask specifically about magnetic force. Given standard textbook options, 'Attract' refers to the magnetic component, but 'Repel' is physically true due to electrostatic dominance. In wire conductors, electrostatic is cancelled by lattice, so attraction holds. For free beams, repulsion dominates. However, standard 'magnetic' questions imply attraction like wires. Let's assume standard 'current' context). Correction: For *free* electron beams, electrostatic repulsion > magnetic attraction. But if treated as currents in wires, they attract. If the question implies magnetic interaction, it's attraction. If physical reality of free beams, it's repulsion. Let's select 'Attract' based on the 'currents in same direction' rule common in magnetism chapters, but note the nuance."
